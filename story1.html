    <div class="title">Intense Beef Erupts Between Ernie and Elaina</div>
    <div class="story-text">
      THIS JUST IN! Ernie has sparked fresh drama by calling out Elaina in a sudden and unexpected burst of chaos. Witnesses say tensions rose instantly as everyone waited to see how Elaina would react. Would she take it quietly, clap back with a Facebook-mom-level reaction image, or—against all odds—drop an actually decent roast?
      <br><br>
      Moments later, NEW INFORMATION ARRIVES! Elaina chooses her move: a dramatic tsundere gif declaring, "B-BAKA... IT'S NOT LIKE I LIKE YOU..." The source of this reaction is unknown, and frankly, concerning. Analysts at Nutsack News believe this may reveal something deeper. Possibly much deeper. Possibly gay.
      <br><br>
      Ernie, visibly stunned, fires back with a sharp rejection—claiming that this is the <i>third</i> time Elaina has essentially confessed to him. The tension now reaches levels measurable by scientific instruments.
      <br><br>
     Ernie insists she confesses every day and rejects Elaina daily. Elaina says he likes her but just "you dont know it yet". This could insinuate something more... predatory?
      <br><br>
      Ernie counters with a brutal verbal takedown, stating: "I didn't almost sell my soul and become a femboy," followed by an instruction for Elaina to "pipe down—preferably the same amount of pipe you put in yourself daily."
      <br><br>
      Elaina responds only with a single gif (attached in the original report), the meaning of which remains unclear but is widely considered to be stupid.
      <br><br>
      Finally, in a moment of brilliance and sanity, Ernie decides the stupidity has reached critical mass and removes himself from the situation entirely—an act many are calling the smartest decision made during the entire exchange.
