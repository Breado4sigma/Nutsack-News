    <p>
      After days of back-and-forth tension, unexpected comments, and nonstop community reaction,
      **Ernie and Elaina have officially squashed their beef**. What began as a chaotic argument
      escalated into one of the most talked-about dramas of the week — but now seems to have ended
      on surprisingly positive terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Witnesses say the two privately settled their differences late last night, with both sides
      agreeing that the situation had gotten “way too dramatic for no reason.” Ernie in particular
      made headlines after stepping forward with a bold new statement:
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:1.3rem; text-align:center; margin:20px 0; color:#d4b8ff;">
      <strong>“#ElijahLivesMatter — We stand united.”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      The hashtag began circulating almost instantly, with many pointing out that **Oliver was the
      one who supposedly helped craft and spread it** across multiple group chats. Whether intended
      as a peace gesture, a meme, or both, the tag caught fire in minutes and became a centerpiece
      of the reconciliation.
    </p>

    <p>
      For now, the community appears relieved that the conflict has cooled off — though, as always,
      time will tell whether this truce holds.
